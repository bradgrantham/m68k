generic 68K platform
    ROM is at 0x4000000 and also at 0x0 on RESET
    32MB RAM is at 0x8000000 to 0xA000000
    IO is at 0xC000000
	RAM_AT_0 = IO_BASE + 3; // write to here to make RAM be at 0 instead of ROM
	OUTPUT_BYTE = IO_BASE + 0; // characters written are output
	INPUT_READY_BYTE = IO_BASE + 1; // characters are ready to read
	INPUT_BYTE = IO_BASE + 2; // character to read
