generic 68K platform
    See bare.ld for ROM, RAM base and see m68k.cpp for IO base
	RAM_AT_0 = IO_BASE + 3; // write to here to make RAM be at 0 instead of ROM
	OUTPUT_BYTE = IO_BASE + 0; // characters written are output
	INPUT_READY_BYTE = IO_BASE + 1; // characters are ready to read
	INPUT_BYTE = IO_BASE + 2; // character to read
